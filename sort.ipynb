    "# Challenges & Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Challenge: Handling Empty Groups (Gender Splitting)\n",
    "- **Problem**: Some M/F groups may have no students, leading to empty groupings.\n",
    "- **Solution**: The `split_students_by_gender` method checks for empty gender lists and removes irrelevant groups:\n",
    "    - If the male list is empty, it is removed.\n",
    "    - If the female list is empty, it is removed.\n",
    "    This ensures only non-empty gender groups remain, making the output cleaner.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Challenge: Managing Group Sizes (CGPA Splitting)\n",
    "- **Problem**: When dividing students by CGPA, groups can become uneven if the number of students isn't perfectly divisible by the desired number of groups.\n",
    "- **Solution**: The code calculates the number of students per CGPA group using `cutoff = CEILING((percentile / 100) * LENGTH(students))`. This ensures that each group has at least the intended minimum number of students, even if the group sizes vary slightly. For example, with 23 students and 4 CGPA groups, the cutoff becomes 5.75 (25% of 23), which rounds up to 6, keeping group sizes balanced.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Challenge: Handling Edge Cases (CGPA Splitting)\n",
    "- **Problem**: With fewer students than groups, some groups may end up empty.\n",
    "- **Solution**: The while loop (`WHILE band_number < size`) ensures students are distributed into available groups, leaving empty groups if there are fewer students than groups. This prevents errors and ensures smooth execution.\n",
    "**Challenge:** \n",
    "Initially, students were ordered by `school -> cgpa -> gender`, but this led to a lack of student diversity for the last few tutorial groups, as they had a majority of males/females.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:** \n",
    "A function `sort_students()` was created to reorganize the 3 factors (`school`, `gender`, `cgpa`). The function splits students starting from the factor with the least number of unique elements and progresses to the factor with the most number of unique elements. \n",
    "\n",
    "This approach ensures greater diversity, as more students are available for selection when moving to the next factor, promoting diversity even towards the end of the sorting process.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "# Improving Randomness in Random Number Generation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Initial Approach: Using `random.random()`\n",
    "- Initially, we used `random.random()` to generate random values.\n",
    "- This method wasn’t truly random because the generated numbers followed a predictable distribution.\n",
    "- As a result, the sequence of values could be reproduced, making the randomness appear fixed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "          ### Improved Approach: Using `random.seed()` with Current Timestamp\n",
    "- We switched to using `random.seed()` with `datetime.datetime.now().timestamp()` to increase randomness.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How It Works:\n",
    "1. **Generate Timestamp**: \n",
    "   - `datetime.datetime.now().timestamp()` provides the current timestamp, which represents a specific point in time, including fractional seconds.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Use Timestamp as Seed**:\n",
    "   - We use this timestamp as the seed for `random.seed()`.\n",
    "   - By seeding the random number generator with the current timestamp, each run of the program produces a different sequence of random numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Benefit of Using `random.seed()` with Timestamp\n",
    "- This approach introduces true randomness, as the sequence of random numbers will differ each time the program runs, based on the current timestamp.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Handling Imbalance in Student Distribution Across Schools and Genders\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem: Imbalance in the Number of Students\n",
    "- Due to an imbalance in the number of students across different schools and genders:\n",
    "  - Some schools or genders may end up with no profiles/students after rounds of selection.\n",
    "- Using `deepcopy` to copy the original list can lead to issues when using `random.choice`:\n",
    "  - If `random.choice` selects a school or gender with an empty profile, this results in a `KeyError`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solution: Using `TryExcept` Handling\n",
    "To address this issue, we use a `try-except` block to manage errors that may occur due to empty selections.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Handle Potential Errors**:\n",
    "   - If an `IndexError` or `KeyError` occurs during selection:\n",
    "     - Remove the current choice from `*_choices_not_chosen` lists as needed to prevent repeated errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Reset Lists When Empty**:\n",
    "   - If the lists are entirely empty, reset them to their original copies using `deepcopy`.\n",
    "   - Continue the selection process with the reset lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Benefits of This Approach\n",
    "- This method ensures that empty selections do not cause the program to crash.\n",
    "- By resetting lists as needed, the program can continue selecting students even when certain schools or genders have limited profiles available.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Challenge:** \n",
    "Initially, students were ordered by `school -> cgpa -> gender`, but this led to a lack of student diversity for the last few tutorial groups, as they had a majority of males/females.\n",
